# Java_Development
Welcome to the Java Development Repository! This repository contains three Java projects aimed at demonstrating various programming concepts and applications. Below is an overview of each project included.

1.NUMBER GAME
    To create a number guessing game, generate a random number within a specified range, such as 1 to 100, and prompt the user to guess the number. Compare their guess with the generated number, providing feedback on whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low. Repeat this process until the user guesses correctly. You can limit the number of attempts, add multiple rounds, and display the user's score based on the number of attempts taken or rounds won.

2.STUDENT GRADE CALCULATOR
    To calculate a student's performance, first, input the marks obtained (out of 100) in each subject. Sum these marks to get the total marks. Next, calculate the average percentage by dividing the total marks by the number of subjects. Based on this average percentage, assign the appropriate grade. Finally, display the total marks, average percentage, and corresponding grade to the user.

3.ATM INTERFACE
    An ATM system is created by developing a class for the ATM machine and designing its user interface with options for withdrawing, depositing, and checking the balance. Methods for each option are implemented, such as withdraw(amount), deposit(amount), and checkBalance(). A class representing the user's bank account is also created to store the account balance, and it is connected to the ATM class to manage balance updates. User input is validated to ensure actions like withdrawals are within acceptable limits, and appropriate messages are displayed based on the success or failure of the transactions.
